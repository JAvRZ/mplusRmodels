TITLE: One factor Random intercepts ML 
DATA: FILE IS "exampledata.dat";
VARIABLE:NAMES ARE ID study intercept sex age edu y1-y12; 
USEVARIABLES ARE study sex age edu y1-y12; 
! intercepts and ID scores have to be ignored, are not in the analysis
CLUSTER = study;
! study defines the second "between" level
WITHIN = sex age edu;
! sex age and education are IVs on level 1
MISSING = .; 
! missing values are coded as ., the Mplus default
ANALYSIS:TYPE = TWOLEVEL;
MODEL:  
  %WITHIN%
  y1-y12 ON sex age edu;
  ! regression coefficients for all variables
  f1 BY y1* y2-y12;
  ! define latent factor on which all variables load
  ! asterisk frees the factor loading, is not restricted to 1
  f1@1;
  ! factor variance is restricted to 1
  y1-y12;
  ! random within study (error) variance is estimated for all vars
  %BETWEEN%
  y1-y12;
  ! random between study (intercept) variance is estimated for all vars
